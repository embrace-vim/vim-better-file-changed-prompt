##################################################
File-Changed Prompt with "Load File" as Default ðŸ—¯
##################################################

This plugin adjusts the default file-changed prompt.

- You probably don't need this plugin it you're happy with |autoread|_.

  - If you're running Vim, ``autoread`` is not enabled by default.

    - Run ``set autoread`` and be happy.

  - If you're running Neovim, you're all set.

But if you want a few quality of life improvements,
sure, maybe check out this plugin!

- For ``vim-gtk`` and MacVim, it makes the prompt a
  little less wordy.

  - For MacVim specifically, it hints at how to use
    the somewhat confusing UX (*there are two buttons
    highlighted in blue â€” so what does pressing <Enter>
    do??*)

- It adds additional alerts where (Neo)Vim is otherwise
  silent.

  - For example, when |autoread|_ is enabled, if a buffer
    is unchanged but its external file changes, Vim loads
    the changes and prints a message.

    But in Neovim, nothing is printed.

    This plugin restores that message.

.. |autoread| replace:: ``autoread``
.. _autoread: https://vimhelp.org/options.txt.html#autoread

Prompt Differences
==================

By default, Vim prompts you if a buffer you're working on
was changed by an external program.

Here's a look at the default prompt on macOS in `MacVim <https://macvim.org/>`__:

.. image:: doc/MacVim-FCS-prompt--builtin.png
   :alt: Default MacVim file-changed prompt
   :align: center

If you're not familiar with macOS dialog wiring:

- The button with the *blue background* is picked
  when you press ``<Enter>``.

- The button with the *blue border* is picked when
  you press ``<Space>``.

- You can move the selected button with ``<Tab>``.

  - Regardless of the selected button, ``<Enter>`` will
    *always* pick the "OK" button.

- There are no accelerators defined (e.g., nothing like
  an ``<Alt-L>`` accelerator you might find on Linux).

This plugin changes the prompt thusly:

.. image:: doc/MacVim-FCS-prompt--better.png
   :alt: Improved MacVim file-changed prompt
   :align: center

You'll see that the prompt text is a little less wordy than the
default, and there's a helpful little hint added to remind you
how ``<Enter>`` and ``<Tab>``/``<Space>`` work on macOS.

- And if you've read |help-W11|_ once, you probably
  don't need to be reminded of it every time.

.. |help-W11| replace:: ``:help W11``
.. _help-W11: https://vimhelp.org/message.txt.html#W11

In the other Vims â€” Linux GVim, terminal ``vim``, and terminal
``nvim`` â€” you'll see similar changes to the prompt.

The different types of Vim file changes
=======================================

Vim identifies at least six different types of changes:

- The file on disk was deleted while a buffer is open.

- The file timestamp was changed.

- The file permissions were changed.

- The file contents were changed, but the buffer has
  not been modified (|help-modified|_).

- The file contents were changed and the buffer has
  local modifications.

- The file on disk was *created* after a buffer with
  that path was opened.

  - This is actually a different prompt altogether
    that is not scriptable (|help-W13|_).

How this plugin handles each of those file changes
--------------------------------------------------

If Vim notices that a file is deleted while a buffer is open,
it alerts, ``E211: File "{filepath}" no longer available``,
but it doesn't prompt.

- If the file is created again, Vim doesn't announce it,
  unless the local buffer has changes.

  - So this plugin emits a message when the deleted file
    has since been *undeleted*.

If Vim notices that only the timestamp has changed, it
won't alert you. It will ignore the event and move on.

- This plugin will instead print a short `message
  <https://vimhelp.org/message.txt.html#%3Amessages>`__
  to bleep you, |because-what-the-hay|_ (but it won't
  prompt you).

- For you |rebasers|_ out there, this event occurs
  frequently when you rebase history.

If Vim notices that the permissions have changed,
the Vim default is to always prompt you.

- This plugin will *not* prompt you when permissions
  change. [Although maybe it should, or at least if
  the file is no longer writable or readable by the
  user. But that's a rare use case we're not gonna
  worry about. But please open an `Issue
  <https://github.com/embrace-vim/vim-better-file-changed-prompt/issues>`__
  if this impacts you negatively.]

If Vim notices external changes and the local buffer
has not been modified, it'll print a message like you'd
normally see when you edit a file, e.g.,:

  ``"file" 3L, 9B``

- Interestingly, in Neovim, nothing is messaged. Neovim
  silently loads changes.

- This plugin prints an alert like Vim does, but telling you
  explicitly what happened (unlike, e.g., ``"file" 3L, 9B``),
  and colorfully, too (imagine the following with a yellow
  background, for example), e.g.,:

  ``File changed! ðŸ“  /path/to/file``

Finally, when conflicts are detected, this plugin will prompt
you, just like Vim or Neovim does, regardless of ``autoread``,
albeit with the dialog changes described earlier.

So, like, *Why?*
================

I originally made this plugin because I wanted to be prompted
when external changes happened, even if there was no conflict,
so that I could choose what to do. But I wanted the default
choices to be opposite Vim's â€” e.g., if ``set noautoread`` and
Vim shows the conflict prompt, the default is to Keep Changes,
but I wanted the default to be Load File.

- So when no conflicts, I wanted to be able to hit <Enter> to
  load changes.

- But when there were conflicts, I wanted to be able to hit
  <Enter> to ignore changes.

Nowadays, I prefer ``autoload`` behavior â€” not to be prompted
when there are external changes but not conflicts, but to just
load changes â€” but I also like the additional messages provided
by this plugin.

  mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/embrace-vim/start
  cd ~/.vim/pack/embrace-vim/start
  git clone https://github.com/embrace-vim/vim-better-file-changed-prompt.git

- Alternatively, install under ``~/.vim/pack/emrace-vim/opt`` and call
  ``:packadd vim-better-file-changed-prompt`` to load the plugin on-demand.
