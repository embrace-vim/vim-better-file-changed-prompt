1. About This Plugin			*vim-nfcp-about*

This plugin makes two changes to the FileChangedShell prompt behavior:

1. The default selected button is 'Load File', so you can just press
   Return (or Space) to reload the file, which is usually the action
   you want. (And it's easy to undo â€” Press `Ctrl-z` and the changes
   are undone).

2. The prompt is not shown for certain types of changes that you
   shouldn't care about, like permissions changes.

USE CASE: If you rebase source code often, you'll find yourself needing
to fix conflicts, but when a file is changed outside of Vim, Vim prompts
you, asking if you want to reload it, but defaulting the selected dialog
button to not reloading the file. If you're tired of seeing this dialog,
and then pressing Tab or using the mouse to select 'Load File' instead of
'OK', then this plugin is for you!
